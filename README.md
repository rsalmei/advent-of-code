# My Advent of Code

Rust solutions to [AoC 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

I like to write clean and idiomatic code, while also keeping it short and efficient.
<br>I always try to use iterators, built-in traits, closures, and generics to make cool and easy to use APIs.
<br>At times I like to be clever, which results in not the easiest codes to understand, but it makes me feel good üòä.

Rust is awesome, but also very hard and challenging, which makes me even more enthusiastic to master it!
<br>I'm doing this to try to improve my Rust, and perhaps I could spread some knowledge along the way.

To run any day, just:
```bash
‚ùØ cargo run --bin dayX
```

If you have any suggestions or doubts, please open an issue or discussion!
<br>I ‚ù§Ô∏è Rust, let's talk about it!
