# My Advent of Code

Rust solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

I like to write clean and idiomatic code, while also keeping them short and efficient to the best of my knowledge. I also love iterators, built-in traits, closures, and generics, and I try to use them all everywhere!
At times I like to be clever, which results in not the easiest code to understand, but it makes me feel good üòä.

Rust is awesome but also very challenging, the steepest learning curve I've ever seen, but that makes me even more enthusiastic about mastering it!
> I'm doing this to play with and improve my Rust, and I hope you may learn something from it too.

Now there's support for any year! To run it, just:
```bash
‚ùØ cargo run --release <year> <day>
```

If you have suggestions or doubts, please open an issue.
