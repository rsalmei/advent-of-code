Rust solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

I like to write clean and idiomatic code, while also keeping it short and efficient.
<br>I always try to use iterators, built-in traits, closures, and generics to make cool and easy to use APIs.
<br>At times I like to be clever, which results in not the easiest codes to understand, but it makes me feel good üòä.

Rust is awesome but also very hard and challenging, which makes me even more enthusiastic in mastering it!
<br>I'm doing this to play with and improve my Rust, and I hope you may learn something with it.

Now there's support for any year! To run it, just:
```bash
‚ùØ cargo run --release <year> <day>
```

If you have suggestions or doubts, you can open an issue.
<br>I ‚ù§Ô∏è Rust, let's talk about it!
