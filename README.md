Rust solutions to AoC 2018

I like to write clean and idiomatic code, but also short and efficient code.
<br>I'm doing this to improve my Rust, and perhaps it could also help someone out there.

To run any day, just:
```bash
❯ cargo run --bin day1
```

If you have any suggestions or doubts, please open an issue or discussion!
<br>I ❤️ Rust, let's talk about it!
